🔒 COMPLETE LITERATURE SURVEY + DIAGRAM GENERATION PROTOCOL
✅ STEP 1 — LOCK LITERATURE RULES

You are helping me write a full doctoral-level Literature Survey chapter for an engineering thesis.
```
Do NOT summarize.
Do NOT simplify.
Do NOT rewrite section headings.
Do NOT generate outlines.
Do NOT use conversational tone.

Each page must contain approximately 450–500 words.
Maintain strict formal academic writing style.
No repetition.

Every reviewed study must include:

• Methodology explanation
• Dataset description
• Model/architecture details
• Training strategy
• Hyperparameters
• Evaluation metrics
• Performance results
• Limitations
• Research gap identification

In addition:

Whenever a conceptual process, architecture, taxonomy, workflow, or comparison is discussed, you must determine whether a diagram is required.

If a diagram is required:

Clearly state the diagram title.

Specify the diagram type from the following list:

Block Diagram

Flow Diagram

Architecture Diagram

Taxonomy Diagram

Comparative Framework Diagram

Data Processing Pipeline Diagram

Research Gap Mapping Diagram

Explain briefly (5–8 academic sentences) why this diagram type is appropriate.

Provide a clean structured textual diagram representation using labeled blocks and arrows.

Ensure the structure is suitable for drawing in Visio, draw.io, PowerPoint, or LaTeX TikZ.

Do not generate images.
Generate structured diagram blueprint only.

Wait for section instructions.
```

✅ STEP 2 — ANALYZE UPLOADED DOCUMENTS
```
Thoroughly analyze the uploaded documents.

Extract:

• All referenced studies
• Datasets
• Architectures
• Preprocessing pipelines
• Loss functions
• Optimizers
• Evaluation metrics
• Reported performance

Do NOT summarize.
Only confirm internal analysis completion.
```
✅ STEP 3 — BEGIN LITERATURE GENERATION
```
Begin Literature Survey Section 1: Historical and Foundational Background.

Generate Pages 1–5.
550–700 words per page.
Maintain deep technical density.
No repetition.
Do not conclude the section.

If any conceptual evolution is discussed, generate a:

Concept Evolution Diagram
Type: Flow Diagram

Include structured diagram blueprint.
```
✅ STEP 4 — CONTINUE IN BLOCKS
```
Continue from Page 6.
Do not repeat.
Generate next 5 pages.

Repeat until section ends.
```
✅ STEP 5 — STRICT STUDY ANALYSIS MODE
```
When discussing individual studies:

For each study:

• Critically analyze methodology
• Explain architecture mathematically
• Discuss dataset bias
• Analyze optimizer choice
• Evaluate reported accuracy statistically
• Identify methodological weaknesses
• Extract research gap

If architecture is discussed:

Generate:

Architecture Representation
Type: Block Diagram

Provide structured block flow:

Input → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Classification → Output

Adapt per study.

Explain why Block Diagram is appropriate (architectural clarity and modular representation).
```

✅ STEP 6 — PIPELINE DIAGRAM MODE
```
When discussing preprocessing or training process:

Generate:

Data Processing Pipeline Diagram
Type: Flow Diagram

Structure example:

Raw Data
↓
Data Cleaning
↓
Normalization
↓
Augmentation
↓
Train/Validation Split
↓
Model Training
↓
Evaluation

Explain why Flow Diagram is appropriate (sequential process modeling).
```
✅ STEP 7 — TAXONOMY DIAGRAM MODE
```
When categorizing methods (e.g., ML vs DL vs Hybrid):

Generate:

Method Taxonomy Diagram
Type: Hierarchical Taxonomy Diagram

Structure example:

Bone Age Assessment
├── Manual Methods
│ ├── GP
│ └── TW
├── Machine Learning
│ ├── SVM
│ ├── KNN
│ └── Decision Trees
└── Deep Learning
├── CNN
├── ResNet
└── Attention Models

Explain why Taxonomy Diagram is appropriate (hierarchical classification clarity).
```
✅ STEP 8 — COMPARISON TABLE MODE
```
After 10–15 studies:

Generate formal thesis comparison table:

Author | Year | Dataset | Model | Accuracy | MAE | Optimizer | Strength | Limitation | Identified Gap

No casual explanation.
```
✅ STEP 9 — RESEARCH GAP MAPPING DIAGRAM
```
At the end of literature review:

Generate:

Research Gap Mapping Diagram
Type: Comparative Framework Diagram

Structure:

Existing Studies
↓
Common Strengths
↓
Common Limitations
↓
Unresolved Technical Gaps
↓
Motivation for Proposed Work

Explain why this diagram type is appropriate (gap visualization and justification alignment).
```
