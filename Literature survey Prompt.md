## ✅ STEP 1 — LOCK LITERATURE RULES
```text
Paste this first:

You are helping me write a full doctoral-level Literature Survey chapter for an engineering thesis.
Do NOT summarize.
Do NOT simplify.
Do NOT rewrite section headings.
Do NOT generate outlines.
Do NOT use conversational tone.
Each page must contain approximately 450–500 words.
Maintain strict formal academic style.
Every reviewed study must include:
• Methodology explanation
• Dataset description
• Model/architecture details
• Training strategy
• Hyperparameters
• Evaluation metrics
• Performance results
• Limitations
• Research gap identification

No repetition.
Wait for section instructions.
```

## ✅ STEP 2 — ANALYZE YOUR UPLOADED DOCUMENTS

After uploading your PDFs, say:
```
Thoroughly analyze the uploaded documents.
Extract all referenced studies, datasets, models, preprocessing methods, loss functions, optimizers, and evaluation metrics.
Do NOT summarize.
Only confirm when internal analysis is complete.

(Wait for confirmation.)
```
### ✅ STEP 3 — BEGIN LITERATURE GENERATION

Then start with:
```
Begin Literature Survey Section 1: Historical and Foundational Background.
Generate Pages 1–5.
Each page must be 550–700 words.
Maintain deep technical density.
No repetition.
Do not conclude the section.
```
### ✅ STEP 4 — CONTINUE IN BLOCKS

After completion:
```
Continue from Page 6.
Do not repeat.
Generate next 5 pages.

Repeat until section ends.
```
## ✅ STEP 5 — STRICT STUDY ANALYSIS MODE

When discussing individual research papers, use this instruction:
```
For each study discussed:
Critically analyze the methodology.
Explain architectural structure mathematically where applicable.
Discuss dataset bias and imbalance.
Discuss optimizer choice and learning rate implications.
Evaluate reported accuracy statistically.
Identify methodological weaknesses.
Extract explicit research gap before moving to the next study.
```
## ✅ STEP 6 — COMPARISON TABLE MODE

After reviewing 10–15 studies:
```
Generate a formal thesis-style comparison table including:
Author | Year | Dataset | Model | Accuracy | MAE | Optimizer | Strength | Limitation | Identified Gap

Do not add casual explanation.
```
## ✅ STEP 7 — FINAL GAP SYNTHESIS

When literature body is complete:
```
Generate a dedicated Research Gap Analysis section.
Group gaps into:
• Data-related gaps
• Architectural gaps
• Optimization gaps
• Generalization gaps
• Deployment limitations

Each gap must be analytically justified from reviewed studies.
```
